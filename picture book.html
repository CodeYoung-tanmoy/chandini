   <p id="one"><b>O</b>ne day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. Much to the rabbitâ€™s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought.</p>
   <p id="two">The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going.</p>
   <p id="three">However,<span> the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up.</span> He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.</p>

   <p id="sven">In acent time, there was a dense forest adjacent to Varanasi.Once, a baby elephant was born in that forest. The infant was so cute and beautiful that all the elephants of the jungle turned up to see him. Never before, they had seen such an attractive baby. So, all of them were very elated. They clebrated the ocasion with much funfair and cheer. In their they pulled down branches of trees, uprooted many trees and small plants. Hundreds of elephnts who ghathered there, trumpeted together and expressed their happiness. The occasion was a happy one for the elephants but not for the other animals of the forest. To hear such terrorizing noise, they all hid themselves wherever they could. The baby who was observing everything from cheering up elephants to terrifired animals runing helter-skelter wasnvery much upset with the whole affair.</p>
   <p id="eight">Though he was just a baby, he found the attitude of his community members very selfish. He did not like the means of celebration, which was causing so much of hardship to others. After sometime, the celebration was over and the elephants returned to their places. However, he could not forget that bitter incident. Time passed and he began growing admist his family and other elephants. However, he never liked his friend's naughty and rampaging ways, which caused trouble and destruction for otherss.This child elelphant was peace and loving. He did not enjoy the company of his friends and so he began staying aloof, away from his mischievous friends.</p>
   <p id="nine">The elephants live a lonely life. He wandered through the forest and roamed in his imaginary world. One day when he was sitting under a tree, he heard crying of some animal. The elephant looked up annd saw a monkey sitting alone on the tree and weeping aloud. The elephant got up and went up close to him. "why are you crying, my little friend?"  asked the elephantin a very compassionate voice. while soobing, the monkey replied, "Sir , I am ill and weak. I could not cope up with my friends while jumping from one tre to another. Therefore, my friends have left me alone and gone away. I am frightened. I may very soon be killed bby some other animal."</p>
   <p id="ten">The elephant was moved by  the monkey's plight. He consoled, "Don't cry! I shall search for your friends in the jungle and soon will be here for rescue." Saying so, the elephant left from there. He went ahead searching for the monkeys. The elephant finally found them playing at a place. The noble elephant went there and said "Friends, it's not right to leave your friend in distress and enjoy like this. Friends are meant for helping each other, specially when they are in trouble."</p>
   <p id="eleven">The monkeys realized their mistake. They apologized to the elephant and rushed towards their ailing friend along with the elephant who was ill could not believe his own eyes that an elephant who was supposed to be the biggest enemy of the monkeys had actually brought his friends for his rescue. His eyes filled with tears of joy. He thanked the elephant, "Sir, you're great! Had you not brought my friends here, I would have died." The other monkeys too thanked the noble elephant for opening their eyes.</p>
